# LibSov

## Summary

### What is it ?
This repository aims to store all my C libs and important functions for later projects.

### How to use this repo
Once you cloned the repository, you can either test the libs using the libmain.c and compiling using the Makefile at the root.

If you want to use specific libs, you just need to copy the file corresponding to the lib you want and paste it in a lib folder in your project.  
After that you only need to compile the lib before compiling your program and add the libx.a in the lib folder to your compiler.  

## Libmy

### What is it ?
This lib contains basic functions in C that I need for my C projects, such as my_strlen to get the length of a string or my_printf which is my own version of the built-in printf.
